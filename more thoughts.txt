would it make sense to build a model where annual climate variables can be used to predict number of floods or storms in a year, perhaps taking in consideration region and subregion effects

if so, could we use a bayesian method to impute disaster, deaths, and affected

then we extend the em-dat dataset with actualFloods, likelyFloods, actualStorms, likelyStorms across all countries over all years

now the next stage would be to look at migration. since the migration data only is measured every 5 years, can we consider this somewhat censored data ?

now it's hard to compare migration stocks across countries, because countries have different populations. so what i want to do is normalize the stock by population. thereby creating a variable that somewhat measures the prevalence of emigration within a population, which can somewhat be thought of as a weight or probability of migrating or a favor or preference to migrate among that population

the reason why i want this ratio is because i want to compare across countries

specifically, i want to make a general statement about climate change and natural disasters and its effect on the desire to migrate among a population

i also want to measure a somewhat delayed effect

so what i actually want to do is gather this

year (year between 1980-2020)
migrationYear (closest 5-year interval in the future -- 1990, 1995, 2000, etc.)
distance (migrationYear - disasterYear)
migrationRate (migrants / population for that country)
numActualDisasters (num of floods/storms in this year)
numActualDiastersCumulative (num of floods/storms since previous 5-year interval)
numLikelyDisasters (num of floods/storms in this year)
numLikelyDiastersCumulative (num of floods/storms since previous 5-year interval)
... similar for deaths, livesAffected, economicImpact

now if you can compare across countries (since migrationRate is normalized to country) then you can break them into different groups
-years where there were no disasters or less or less intense (deaths, impact) in the five year period
- years with disasters or likely disasters

then perhaps we can see a difference between those groups 
by comparing the distance to migrationRate between those groups
we could see if the existence of disasters have a higher migrationRate than when not or when likely
and we cuold run a regression to see this perhaps

does thi smake sense
